With user testing going well, and product market fit becoming clearer and clearer (in a good way), I began looking at how I could bring awareness to my app and this genre of game in general. After weeks of isolated work on the MVP and hosting user testing sessions, I realized I needed to find partners in my target audience’s community who already had a platform.

It was important for learning the following:
<ul>
<li>What offerings are already on the table for my target audience.</li>
<li>Community partners’ assessment on product market fit of my game.</li>
<li>Whether my game would fit into their business strategy and if a partnership between us would be possible.</li>
<li>Getting a close-up view of my target audience’s preferences and behaviours.</li>
</ul>

Marketing is not a natural strength (I don’t even post on social media for my personal life!) but I know I’ll need a solid list of potential customers waitlisted for when I launch my game. Networking in the community and spreading awareness is a step I need to take now that I have a working MVP – the earlier, the better. It takes time to build that customer base. 

Luckily for me, this kind of networking is a lot of fun! Board game lovers are the best, none of it feels like work since we’re all driven by passion for the game.

That’s all for this post! Thanks for following my journey this far.
