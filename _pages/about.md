Hi, I'm Ophelia. I'm a product and process specialist with more than 6 years experience working in fintech. 

I specialize in building digital, customer-centric experiences from the ground up, whose foundations begin with empathy and user data. Commanding expertise in both process and product toolboxes, I thrive when collaborating with cross-functional teams to solve complex problems. On the other hand, I also know when the situation calls for rolling up my sleeves to get things done. It’s a challenge I’m always up for.

I carry my love for product and tech into my personal life with a project to build a multiplayer murder mystery app. I’ve spent countless hours over the last several years hosting these kinds of games for friends and colleagues. I believe there is a niche in the market for a digital version that eliminates the need for a host and prep time. Just start the app and start playing within seconds! If anything, I will certainly be its biggest user.

This project combines my product skillset, my drive to learn new skills, and my passion for bringing people together through social games. I'll be tracking my progress in this blog. If what I'm doing interests you, come along on my journey and walk with me!
